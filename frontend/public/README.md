# Structured Text Simulator

## Welcome to the CODESYS-like Structured Text Simulator!

This simulator allows you to write, test, and visualize Structured Text (ST) programs in a web browser. It features a CODESYS-inspired interface with real-time visualization of variables, execution paths, and PLC-like behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Use the editor on the left to write your Structured Text program
2. Click the "Run" button to execute the program
3. Watch the execution in real-time with the animated code view
4. Monitor variables in the CODESYS-like display
5. Use the trace chart to track numeric variables over time

## Available Examples

- **Boolean Logic**: Basic boolean operations and conditional statements
- **Timers**: Using TON, TOF, and TP timers
- **Counters**: CTU and CTD counter operations
- **PLC Sequence**: A multi-step sequence mimicking industrial PLC applications

## Visualization Components

- **Boolean Visualizer**: Shows ON/OFF states with visual indicators
- **Timer Visualizer**: Displays timer progress and states
- **Counter Visualizer**: Shows counter values with animations
- **ST Code Animator**: Highlights executing code lines in real-time

## Tips

- Use the variable editor to change values during simulation
- Enable variable tracking to see values change over time
- Check the execution path to understand the program flow
- Use the debug controls to step through code execution
